## Hi there 👋
🌱 I’m currently learning introductions to front and back end development as well as cloud based architecture<br>
💡 I plan on landing my first role by the end of 2025 to start supporting a development team<br>
🤔 I’m looking for help with narrowing my focus, I'm most interest in:
  <ul>
  <li>Collaborating with others to help overcome road blocks</li>
  <li>Discussing cloud based data storage</li>
  <li>Experimenting new skills to refine overall knowledge</li>
</ul><br>
⚡ Fun fact: I was a long jumper for the UNC Chapel Hill Track and Field team 🏃🏻‍♂️
